# Class-Diagram-Encapsulation-Activity

task:
We’ve just had a request from a school and they would like to track student grades for the Mathematics class. It’s the end of the school term and
the teacher would like to input the student grades into a system. They would like your help to design and code up a Java class to represent a
student.
